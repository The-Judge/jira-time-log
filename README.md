# jira-time-log
A tool which reads a file from Google Drive, extract it's content and log time based on that content to Jira tasks.

The idea is to use it together with the Android App ["Zeiterfassung (Pro) (com.dynamicg.timerecording.pro)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dynamicg.timerecording.pro), which can Backup it's SQlite database to Google Drive upon each change.
